EventEx: Multiple section form submission for Symphony CMS

[CHANGE LOG]

1.0 - initial build

[ABSTRACT]

Typically Symphony events have been restricted to creating and modifying entries in a single section, a conceptual limitation that, amongst other minor things, stunts the creation of complex, single-page forms. EventEx (named rather dissapointingly for its position in the programmatic hierarchy: EXtending the Event class) aims to provide more power and flexibility to user input, especially in conjunction with other utilities, especially Form Controls (http://github.com/nickdunn/form-controls/).

[INSTALLATION]

** Note: The newest version is available at http://github.com/yourheropaul/eventex/tree/master*  
** Note also: EventEx has a dependency - DatabaseManipulator (http://github.com/yourheropaul/databasemanipulator) - which in turn has a dependency: ASDC (http://github.com/pointybeard/asdc). Both are small, unobtrusive Symphony extensions, and extremely useful in their own right.*

1. Place the 'eventex' directory in the Symphony 'extensions' director.
2. Enable the extension in the 'System/Extensions' menu of the Symphony back-end.
