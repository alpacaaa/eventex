<p>1.0 - initial build</p>

<hr>

<p>[ABSTRACT]</p>

<p>Typically Symphony events have been restricted to creating and modifying entries in a single section, a conceptual limitation that, amongst other minor things, stunts the creation of complex, single-page forms. EventEx (named rather dissapointingly for its position in the programmatic hierarchy: EXtending the Event class) aims to provide more power and flexibility to user input, especially in conjunction with other utilities, especially Form Controls (http://github.com/nickdunn/form-controls/).</p>

<p>[INSTALLATION]</p>

<p><em>* Note: The newest version is available at http://github.com/yourheropaul/eventex/tree/master</em>
<em>* Note also: EventEx has a dependency - DatabaseManipulator (http://github.com/yourheropaul/databasemanipulator) - which in turn has a dependency: ASDC (http://github.com/pointybeard/asdc). Both are small, unobtrusive Symphony extensions, and extremely useful in their own right.</em></p>

<li>Place the &#8216;eventex&#8217; directory in the Symphony &#8216;extensions&#8217; director.</li>
